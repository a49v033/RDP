# Google Colaboratory RDP Server
This is an RDP Server to connect to the Google Colaboratory machine(?) via RDP to make it easier to use.
You can use it anytime as long as it isn't deprecated yet because of google itself. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/alok676875/">alok676875<a/> for the original code, and <a href="https://github.com/mzrtamp/">mzrtamp<a/> for helping me.
